        "\n",
        "This project focuses on building a **Reflective Dynamic Planning Agent for Multi-Step Complex Query Analysis**, designed to break down user queries or tasks into manageable steps, execute them iteratively, and update the plan dynamically through reflection and replanning. The components of the system are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Plan Creation**:\n",
        "   - The agent begins by analyzing the user's input (topic or question) to create a **step-by-step plan** of sub-questions or steps needed to solve the overall task.\n",
        "   - Each step is clearly outlined in the **step-by-step plan** for sequential execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Step Execution**:\n",
        "   - The agent executes one step at a time using **OpenAI GPT-4o**.\n",
        "   - During execution:\n",
        "     - External tools, such as the **web search tool**, are used to gather required information or data for the step.\n",
        "     - The result of the executed step is captured and stored in the agent's state.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reflection and Replanning**:\n",
        "   - After each step, the system evaluates the results and sends the **overall plan**, **steps executed**, **results**, and **remaining steps** to the **Replanner**.\n",
        "   - The **Replanner**:\n",
        "     - Assesses whether the remaining steps need modification based on the current results and any new insights.\n",
        "     - Updates the remaining steps if necessary, ensuring alignment with the overall objective.\n",
        "   - This iterative loop ensures adaptability to errors, incomplete data, or unforeseen circumstances.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dynamic Feedback Loop**:\n",
        "   - The system monitors the status of the response:\n",
        "     - If all steps are executed successfully or an error occurs, the process halts.\n",
        "     - If there are remaining steps, the agent continues executing them one at a time, integrating results dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Agent State Maintenance**:\n",
        "   - Throughout the process, the agent maintains a record of:\n",
        "     - The **original plan**.\n",
        "     - **Executed steps and their results**.\n",
        "     - **Remaining steps** for further execution.\n",
        "   - This stateful approach ensures traceability and transparency in the agent’s decision-making process.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Final Response Compilation**:\n",
        "   - Once all steps are executed or the process encounters an error, the agent compiles everything to generate the final reponse.\n",

              "'Discover content by tools and technology\\nDiscover content by data science topics\\nLangGraph Tutorial: What Is LangGraph and How to Use It?\\nImagine you\\'re building a complex, multi-agent large language model (LLM) application. It\\'s exciting, but it comes with challenges: managing the state of various agents, coordinating their interactions, and handling errors effectively. This is where LangGraph can help.\\nLangGraph is a library within the LangChain ecosystem designed to tackle these challenges head-on. LangGraph provides a framework for defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM agents (or chains) in a structured manner.\\nIt simplifies the development process by enabling the creation of cyclical graphs, which are essential for developing agent runtimes. With LangGraph, we can easily build robust, scalable, and flexible multi-agent systems.\\nIf you want to learn more about the LangChain ecosystem, I recommend this introduction to LangChain.\\nWhat Is LangGraph?\\nLangGraph enables us to create stateful, multi-actor applications utilizing LLMs as easily as possible. It extends the capabilities of LangChain, introducing the ability to create and manage cyclical graphs, which are pivotal for developing sophisticated agent runtimes. The core concepts of LangGraph include: graph structure, state management, and coordination.\\nGraph structure\\nImagine your application as a directed graph. In LangGraph, each node represents an LLM agent, and the edges are the communication channels between these agents. This structure allows for clear and manageable workflows, where each agent performs specific tasks and passes information to other agents as needed.\\nState management\\nOne of LangGraph\\'s standout features is its automatic state management. This feature enables us to track and persist information across multiple interactions. As agents perform their tasks, the state is dynamically updated, ensuring the system maintains context and responds appropriately to new inputs.\\nCoordination\\nLangGraph ensures agents execute in the correct order and that necessary information is exchanged seamlessly. This coordination is vital for complex applications where multiple agents need to work together to achieve a common goal. By managing the flow of data and the sequence of operations, LangGraph allows developers to focus on the high-level logic of their applications rather than the intricacies of agent coordination.\\nWhy LangGraph?\\nAs I mentioned above, LangGraph offers several significant advantages for developers working with complex LLM applications. Here are some of the real-world benefits LangGraph offers.\\nSimplified development\\nLangGraph abstracts away the complexities associated with state management and agent coordination. This means developers can define their workflows and logic without worrying about the underlying mechanisms that ensure data consistency and proper execution order. This simplification accelerates the development process and reduces the likelihood of errors. It’s a game-changer!\\nFlexibility\\nWith LangGraph, developers have the flexibility to define their own agent logic and communication protocols. This allows for highly customized applications tailored to specific use cases. Whether you need a chatbot that can handle various types of user requests or a multi-agent system that performs complex tasks, LangGraph provides the tools to build exactly what you need. It’s all about giving you the power to create.\\nScalability\\nLangGraph is built to support the execution of large-scale multi-agent applications. Its robust architecture can handle a high volume of interactions and complex workflows, enabling the development of scalable systems that can grow with your needs. This makes it suitable for enterprise-level applications and scenarios where performance and reliability are critical.\\nFault tolerance\\nReliability is a core consideration in the design of LangGraph. The library includes mechanisms for gracefully handling errors, ensuring that your application can continue to operate even when individual agents encounter issues. This fault tolerance is essential for maintaining the stability and robustness of complex multi-agent systems. Peace of mind is just a feature away.\\nGetting Started With LangGraph\\nLet’s see how we can set up LangGraph and what the basic concepts are.\\nInstallation\\nTo install LangGraph, you can use pip:\\nBasic Concepts\\nNodes: Nodes represent units of work within your LangGraph. They are typically Python functions that perform a specific task, such as:\\nIn LangGraph, you can add nodes using the graph.add_node(name, value) syntax.\\nEdges: Edges are communication channels between nodes. They define the flow of information and the order of execution. You can add edges using the graph.add_edge(node1, node2) syntax.\\nState: The state is a central object updated over time by the nodes in the graph. It manages the internal state of your application and can be overridden or added to, depending on the application\\'s requirements. This state can hold things such as:\\nBuilding a Simple LangGraph Application\\nHere’s a step-by-step example of creating a basic chatbot application using LangGraph.\\nStep 1: Define the StateGraph\\nDefine a StateGraph object to structure the chatbot as a state machine. The State is a class object defined with a single key messages of type List and uses the add_messages() function to append new messages rather than overwrite them.\\nStep 2: Initialize an LLM and add it as a Chatbot node\\nHere, we initialize the AzureChatOpenAI model and create a simple chatbot function that takes in the state messages as input and generates a message response (which is subsequently appended to the state).\\nThis chatbot function is added as a node named “chatbot” to the graph.\\nStep 3: Set edges\\nSince we are building a simple chatbot, we set the chatbot node as both the entry and finish points of the graph to indicate where to start and end the process.\\nStep 4: Compile and Visualize the Graph\\nCompile the graph to create a CompiledGraph object, and optionally, we can visualize the graph structure using the code below:\\nStep 5: Run the chatbot\\nFinally, we implement a loop to continuously prompt the user for input, process it through the graph, and print the assistant\\'s response. The loop exits when the user types \"quit\", \"exit\", or \"q\".\\nAdvanced LangGraph Features\\nNow that we covered the basics, let’s take a look at some advanced features.\\nCustom node types\\nLangGraph allows you to create custom node types to implement complex agent logic. This provides flexibility and control over your application\\'s behavior.\\nHere, we define a class MyCustomNode that encapsulates custom logic and interacts with the LLM. This provides a more structured and maintainable way to implement complex node behaviors.\\nEdge types\\nLangGraph supports different edge types to handle various communication patterns between nodes. One useful type is the conditional edge, which allows for decision-making based on a node\\'s output.\\nTo create a conditional edge, you need three components:\\nHere\\'s an example in pseudocode:\\nHere, after the “model” node is called, we can either exit the graph (”end”) and return to the user, or we can continue (”continue”) and call a tool—depending on what the user decides!\\nState management\\nLangGraph offers powerful state management techniques, which include using external databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, or cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage to store and retrieve your agent\\'s state, enabling reliability and scalability.\\nHere\\'s an example of using a SQLite database for state management:\\nError handling\\nLangGraph also provides mechanisms for error handling:\\nReal-World Applications of LangGraph\\nLangGraph can be used to build a wide range of applications.\\nChatbots\\nLangGraph is ideal for developing sophisticated chatbots that can handle a wide array of user requests. By leveraging multiple LLM agents, these chatbots can process natural language queries, provide accurate responses, and seamlessly switch between different conversation topics. The ability to manage state and coordinate interactions ensures that the chatbot maintains context and delivers a coherent user experience.\\nAutonomous agents\\nFor applications requiring autonomous decision-making, LangGraph enables the creation of agents that can perform tasks independently based on user inputs and predefined logic.\\nThese agents can execute complex workflows, interact with other systems, and adapt to new information dynamically. LangGraph\\'s structured framework ensures that each agent operates efficiently and effectively, making it suitable for tasks like automated customer support, data processing, and system monitoring.\\nMulti-Agent systems\\nLangGraph excels in building applications where multiple agents collaborate to achieve a common goal. For example, different agents can manage inventory, process orders, and coordinate deliveries in a supply chain management system. LangGraph\\'s coordination capabilities ensure that each agent communicates effectively, sharing information and making decisions in a synchronized manner. This leads to more efficient operations and better overall system performance.\\nWorkflow automation tools\\nWith LangGraph, automating business processes and workflows becomes straightforward. Intelligent agents can be designed to handle tasks such as document processing, approval workflows, and data analysis. By defining clear workflows and leveraging LangGraph\\'s state management, these tools can execute complex sequences of actions without human intervention, reducing errors and increasing productivity.\\nRecommendation systems\\nPersonalized recommendation systems can greatly benefit from LangGraph\\'s capabilities. By employing multiple agents to analyze user behavior, preferences, and contextual data, these systems can deliver tailored suggestions for products, content, or services. LangGraph\\'s flexibility allows for integrating various data sources and algorithms, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.\\nPersonalized learning environments\\nIn educational platforms, LangGraph can be used to create adaptive learning environments that cater to individual learning styles and needs. Multiple agents can assess a student\\'s progress, provide customized exercises, and offer real-time feedback. The stateful nature of LangGraph ensures that the system retains information about each learner\\'s performance and preferences, enabling a more personalized and effective educational experience.\\nConclusion\\nLangGraph significantly simplifies the development of complex LLM applications by providing a structured framework for managing state and coordinating agent interactions.\\nPotential developments for LangGraph include integration with other LangChain components, support for new LLM models, and the introduction of more advanced agent runtimes from academia.\\nIf you want to learn more about developing applications within the LangChain ecosystem, I recommend this course on developing LLM applications with LangChain.\\nRyan is a lead data scientist specialising in building AI applications using LLMs. He is a PhD candidate in Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graphs at Imperial College London, where he also completed his Master’s degree in Computer Science.

It's exciting, but it comes with challenges: managing the state of various agents, coordinating their interactions, and handling errors effectively. This is where LangGraph can help.\\nLangGraph is a library within the LangChain ecosystem designed to tackle these challenges head-on. LangGraph provides a framework for defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM agents (or chains) in a structured manner.\\nIt simplifies the development process by enabling the creation of cyclical graphs, which are essential for developing agent runtimes. With LangGraph, we can easily build robust, scalable, and flexible multi-agent systems.\\nIf you want to learn more about the LangChain ecosystem, I recommend this introduction to LangChain.\\nWhat Is LangGraph?\\nLangGraph enables us to create stateful, multi-actor applications utilizing LLMs as easily as possible. It extends the capabilities of LangChain, introducing the ability to create and manage cyclical graphs, which are pivotal for developing sophisticated agent runtimes. The core concepts of LangGraph include: graph structure, state management, and coordination.\\nGraph structure\\nImagine your application as a directed graph. In LangGraph, each node represents an LLM agent, and the edges are the communication channels between these agents. This structure allows for clear and manageable workflows, where each agent performs specific tasks and passes information to other agents as needed.\\nState management\\nOne of LangGraph's standout features is its automatic state management. This feature enables us to track and persist information across multiple interactions. As agents perform their tasks, the state is dynamically updated, ensuring the system maintains context and responds appropriately to new inputs.\\nCoordination\\nLangGraph ensures agents execute in the correct order and that necessary information is exchanged seamlessly. This coordination is vital for complex applications where multiple agents need to work together to achieve a common goal. By managing the flow of data and the sequence of operations, LangGraph allows developers to focus on the high-level logic of their applications rather than the intricacies of agent coordination.\\nWhy LangGraph?\\nAs I mentioned above, LangGraph offers several significant advantages for developers working with complex LLM applications. Here are some of the real-world benefits LangGraph offers.\\nSimplified development\\nLangGraph abstracts away the complexities associated with state management and agent coordination. This means developers can define their workflows and logic without worrying about the underlying mechanisms that ensure data consistency and proper execution order. This simplification accelerates the development process and reduces the likelihood of errors. It’s a game-changer!\\nFlexibility\\nWith LangGraph, developers have the flexibility to define their own agent logic and communication protocols. This allows for highly customized applications tailored to specific use cases. Whether you need a chatbot that can handle various types of user requests or a multi-agent system that performs complex tasks, LangGraph provides the tools to build exactly what you need. It’s all about giving you the power to create.\\nScalability\\nLangGraph is built to support the execution of large-scale multi-agent applications. Its robust architecture can handle a high volume of interactions and complex workflows, enabling the development of scalable systems that can grow with your needs. This makes it suitable for enterprise-level applications and scenarios where performance and reliability are critical.\\nFault tolerance\\nReliability is a core consideration in the design of LangGraph. The library includes mechanisms for gracefully handling errors, ensuring that your application can continue to operate even when individual agents encounter issues. This fault tolerance is essential for maintaining the stability and robustness of complex multi-agent systems. Peace of mind is just a feature away.\\nGetting Started With LangGraph\\nLet’s see how we can set up LangGraph and what the basic concepts are.\\nInstallation\\nTo install LangGraph, you can use pip:\\nBasic Concepts\\nNodes: Nodes represent units of work within your LangGraph. They are typically Python functions that perform a specific task, such as:\\nIn LangGraph, you can add nodes using the graph.add_node(name, value) syntax.\\nEdges: Edges are communication channels between nodes. They define the flow of information and the order of execution. You can add edges using the graph.add_edge(node1, node2) syntax.\\nState: The state is a central object updated over time by the nodes in the graph. It manages the internal state of your application and can be overridden or added to, depending on the application's requirements. This state can hold things such as:\\nBuilding a Simple LangGraph Application\\nHere’s a step-by-step example of creating a basic chatbot application using LangGraph.\\nStep 1: Define the StateGraph\\nDefine a StateGraph object to structure the chatbot as a state machine. The State is a class object defined with a single key messages of type List and uses the add_messages() function to append new messages rather than overwrite them.\\nStep 2: Initialize an LLM and add it as a Chatbot node\\nHere, we initialize the AzureChatOpenAI model and create a simple chatbot function that takes in the state messages as input and generates a message response (which is subsequently appended to the state).\\nThis chatbot function is added as a node named “chatbot” to the graph.\\nStep 3: Set edges\\nSince we are building a simple chatbot, we set the chatbot node as both the entry and finish points of the graph to indicate where to start and end the process.\\nStep 4: Compile and Visualize the Graph\\nCompile the graph to create a CompiledGraph object, and optionally, we can visualize the graph structure using the code below:\\nStep 5: Run the chatbot\\nFinally, we implement a loop to continuously prompt the user for input, process it through the graph, and print the assistant's response. The loop exits when the user types \\\"quit\\\", \\\"exit\\\", or \\\"q\\\".\\nAdvanced LangGraph Features\\nNow that we covered the basics, let’s take a look at some advanced features.\\nCustom node types\\nLangGraph allows you to create custom node types to implement complex agent logic. This provides flexibility and control over your application's behavior.\\nHere, we define a class MyCustomNode that encapsulates custom logic and interacts with the LLM. This provides a more structured and maintainable way to implement complex node behaviors.\\nEdge types\\nLangGraph supports different edge types to handle various communication patterns between nodes. One useful type is the conditional edge, which allows for decision-making based on a node's output.\\nTo create a conditional edge, you need three components:\\nHere's an example in pseudocode:\\nHere, after the “model” node is called, we can either exit the graph (”end”) and return to the user, or we can continue (”continue”) and call a tool—depending on what the user decides!\\nState management\\nLangGraph offers powerful state management techniques, which include using external databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, or cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage to store and retrieve your agent's state, enabling reliability and scalability.\\nHere's an example of using a SQLite database for state management:\\nError handling\\nLangGraph also provides mechanisms for error handling:\\nReal-World Applications of LangGraph\\nLangGraph can be used to build a wide range of applications.\\nChatbots\\nLangGraph is ideal for developing sophisticated chatbots that can handle a wide array of user requests. By leveraging multiple LLM agents, these chatbots can process natural language queries, provide accurate responses, and seamlessly switch between different conversation topics. The ability to manage state and coordinate interactions ensures that the chatbot maintains context and delivers a coherent user experience.\\nAutonomous agents\\nFor applications requiring autonomous decision-making, LangGraph enables the creation of agents that can perform tasks independently based on user inputs and predefined logic.\\nThese agents can execute complex workflows, interact with other systems, and adapt to new information dynamically. LangGraph's structured framework ensures that each agent operates efficiently and effectively, making it suitable for tasks like automated customer support, data processing, and system monitoring.\\nMulti-Agent systems\\nLangGraph excels in building applications where multiple agents collaborate to achieve a common goal. For example, different agents can manage inventory, process orders, and coordinate deliveries in a supply chain management system. LangGraph's coordination capabilities ensure that each agent communicates effectively, sharing information and making decisions in a synchronized manner. This leads to more efficient operations and better overall system performance.\\nWorkflow automation tools\\nWith LangGraph, automating business processes and workflows becomes straightforward. Intelligent agents can be designed to handle tasks such as document processing, approval workflows, and data analysis. By defining clear workflows and leveraging LangGraph's state management, these tools can execute complex sequences of actions without human intervention, reducing errors and increasing productivity.\\nRecommendation systems\\nPersonalized recommendation systems can greatly benefit from LangGraph's capabilities. By employing multiple agents to analyze user behavior, preferences, and contextual data, these systems can deliver tailored suggestions for products, content, or services. LangGraph's flexibility allows for integrating various data sources and algorithms, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.\\nPersonalized learning environments\\nIn educational platforms, LangGraph can be used to create adaptive learning environments that cater to individual learning styles and needs. Multiple agents can assess a student's progress, provide customized exercises, and offer real-time feedback. The stateful nature of LangGraph ensures that the system retains information about each learner's performance and preferences, enabling a more personalized and effective educational experience.\\nConclusion\\nLangGraph significantly simplifies the development of complex LLM applications by providing a structured framework for managing state and coordinating agent interactions.\\nPotential developments for LangGraph include integration with other LangChain components, support for new LLM models, and the introduction of more advanced agent runtimes from academia.\\nIf you want to learn more about developing applications within the LangChain ecosystem, I recommend this course on developing LLM applications with LangChain.\\nRyan is a lead data scientist specialising in building AI applications using LLMs. He is a PhD candidate in Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graphs at Imperial College London, where he also completed his Master’s degree in Computer Science.
