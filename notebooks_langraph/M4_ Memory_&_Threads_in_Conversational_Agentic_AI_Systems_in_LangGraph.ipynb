Here’s how it works.\\n\\nWell, that flew by, didn’t it? OpenAI has officially called it a wrap on its 12 Days of OpenAI Christmas gifts. To his credit, Sam Altman – OpenAI CEO – originally teased that there would be \\\"some big ones and some stocking stuffers,” and that’s what was delivered.\\nThe big ones certainly stood out the most, though, and leading that was the formal arrival of Sora. OpenAI’s text-to-video generator is officially rolled out to all folks with a ChatGPT Pro subscription. We quickly went hands-on with it, just like the rest of the internet. But even before that, day one brought the release of a new LLM, ChatGPT o1.\\nOf course, if you have an iPhone capable of Apple Intelligence, there’s a good chance you’ve been playing around with the ChatGPT integration. And for folks who regularly use ChatGPT, there were a few new features, including Canvas and Projects.\\nHowever, maybe the most teasing of future ‘agentic’ abilities would be the updates now live for ChatGPT’s Mac app and forthcoming for the Windows app. On the Mac, you can now grant access to ChatGPT to view the app you are in and essentially help with your workflows. In Xcode or Warp, you can even ask ChatGPT to help write in a few programming languages, and in Notes or Notion, it can put its pen to paper and help write.\\nNow, ahead, we’ve got a quick shortlist of everything unveiled during the ‘12 Days of OpenAI’, and you can relive the excitement by looking back through our massive, in-depth live blog, in which we broke down the news as it was revealed.\\nOur live blog was run by some of the most experienced tech writers in the industry, including Graham Barlow, Senior Editor of AI, John-Anthony Disotto, Senior Writer of AI, Lance Ulanoff, Editor-at-Large, and Jacob Krol, US Managing Editor of News.\\n12 days of OpenAI – everything announced\\nLIVE UPDATES\\n\\nWelcome to day eight of '12 Days of OpenAI'! We've had the weekend to think about all the good stuff OpenAI released last week (Sora, ChatGPT Canvas and Projects, plus ChatGPT o1) and that's got us wondering what we can expect from the AI giant this week?There's still been nothing announced on the AI image generation front, so could we see a new DALL-E release today?We're here from today until Friday this week (the 20th) when we'll get our final day of OpenAI releases. Today's announcement will kick off at 10am PT, so don't miss it.\\nMy favorite announcement from last week?\\n\\nToday is a good day to reflect on the goodies that OpenAI announced last week, and while Sora was the highlight, without a doubt, it was another of its announcements that I found the most useful...I'm talking about the Canvas feature. As I wrote at the time, it has completely changed the way I use ChatGPT. The new writing tools are really useful, and I love the way you can keep refining the same piece of text over and over, without having to keep generating reams of text each time you want to change just one element of it. If you haven't had a play with Canvas yet I'd recommend you give it a go. It's free!\\nLet's talk about AI images\\n\\nCould we see a major update to DALL-E in today's announcement? I highly doubt it, but you never know.\\nToday, TechRadar's Senior AI Writer, John-Anthony Disotto, has been testing Grok, a competitor to DALL-E from xAI, Elon Musk's AI company. Grok 2 is now free to all users on X (formerly Twitter), and it's capable of some crazy unrestricted image generation results.\\nIn his piece, titled \\\"I used Grok’s new free tier on X but I can’t show you the results because it could infringe Nintendo's copyright\\\", he talks about how OpenAI's AI image generator won't create images of copyrighted characters or public figures, while Grok will do whatever you ask it to. Despite the limitations, DALL-E 3 as part of ChatGPT remains one of our picks for best AI image generator, but could it get a whole lot better in today's announcement? Time will tell.\\nTime for an AI podcast generator?\\n\\nSomething we haven't seen from OpenAI so far is an AI podcast generator. While Google has been having a lot of success with NotebookLM, its research tool that will generate a fantastically real podcast between two AI hosts from whatever text, video or PDF sources you feed it, we haven't seen anything from OpenAI on this front so far.Google is rolling out a new feature to NotebookLM that lets you join in the conversation with the AI hosts too.\\nNotebookLM has been so popular that we're starting to wonder if this week we'll see OpenAI step into the AI podcast game with one of its '12 Days of OpenAI' releases? Time will tell.\\nWe asked ChatGPT what announcement we'll get today\\n\\nWe asked ChatGPT what it thought that OpenAI would be releasing today because, well, if anybody should know it should be ChatGPT, right? It came back with:\\\"Given that image generation updates have been notably absent so far, many speculate that a DALL-E update could be coming today. The announcement is scheduled for 10 a.m. PT, so keep an eye out for news regarding potential advancements in OpenAI's creative tools and accessibility features.\\\"To be honest, we think it's right, but it also sounds a lot like ChatGPT has been reading our own blog post on the subject of today's release (see down below), so, er, thanks for nothing ChatGPT...\\nIt's all about ChatGPT Search for Day 8\\nAnd away we go! OpenAI is kicking off day 8 of its 12 Days of announcements. Kevin, OpenAI's product lead, is kicking things off and quickly shared that the focus for today is ChatGPT Search.\\nFirst, it's arriving to everyone globally and on every platform where ChatGPT is available beginning today. OpenAI is also saying broadly that they've made ChatGPT Search better and are rolling out the ability to search while you're talking with ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode.\\n\\nBeyond rolling out ChatGPT search to even more users, OpenAI is also integrating the feature more seamlessly into its Android or iOS mobile app. When you ask a question, say a restaurant in a specific area, like how the OpenAI team demoed during the reveal, it will list the results in line. Further, you can have a more natural conversation about the results to find what you're truly after. It's pretty neat.\\nOnce you find a restaurant in the ChatGPT app for iOS, you can also get directions via Apple Maps as it is integrated.\\nAlso, within the mobile app, you can talk with ChatGPT using voice mode, and it will weave search results and broader web information into its response. For instance, if you're asking for a Christmas market, you can even get more specific for hours and days of operation.\\n\\nJust as quickly as day 8 of 12 Days of OpenAI began, it's already come to a close. ChatGPT Search was the focus, with some significant enhancements and a much larger rollout for logged-in free users globally, where ChatGPT is available. Much like Canvas, you'll need a free account to use ChatGPT search and get high rate limits.\\nKevin also teased that tomorrow, Day 9, will be a mini developer day, so expect the focus to be less on consumer features and more on larger tools.\\nWelcome to day nine!\\n\\nWelcome to day nine of 12 Days of OpenAI! Yesterday was a true Christmas cracker, since we got ChatGPT search released to all ChatGPT users, including those on the free tier. The OpenAI team hinted that today's announcement would be more developer focussed, but check back at 10am PT and we'll have the news for you as it happens.\\nOperator agent\\n\\nWith many expecting AI agents (autonomous AI bots that do your bidding) being a key feature of 2025, we're still wondering if we'll see the release of Operator from OpenAI this week. The smart money is on it closing the show on Friday.Operator would be able to control your browser, which means it could do any task that you currently use your browser for, which, when you think about it, is probably about 90% of what you use your computer for.Operator is already tipped to land in January, so it's not out of the bounds of possibility that OpenAI has brought the release forward a few weeks.\\nChatGPT search vs Perplexity\\n\\nWith OpenAI dropping some updates to the ChatGPT search function yesterday, our Senior AI Editor, Graham, thought it would be a good time to compare what ChatGPT's AI search function can do against Perplexity, which has been doing AI search for a while now. He was quite surprised by the results. Have a read and see what you think.\\nToday's more developer-focused announcement will be happening at 10am PT.\\nIt's time for day nine of the 12 Days of OpenAI, and as teased during day eight, we're fully expecting a mini developer day of sorts. And right away, it's confirmed that it's all about how developers and startups can build off of the OpenAI API.\\nFor starters, o1 is launching out of preview in the API today, and based on feedback function calling, developer messages, and structured output are arriving with the model. OpenAI will launch a \\\"reasoning effort\\\" tool within the o1 model, which lets you tell the AI how long to spend on a task.\\nLastly, there is a vision aspect of the o1 model – in the example, it looks at a tax form and can help detect issues in the form. To do this, OpenAI opened up its developer program, and through a \\\"Developer Message,\\\" you can provide instructions on how it should work. This was written out, the tax forms were uploaded, and the AI analyzed the image and marked the errors. o1 here is analyzing the uploaded and provides written answers.\\nOne piece of good news is that o1 uses 60% less tokens than o1 preview, which should mean you get even more value out of the o1 release, which is rolling out today – though it will take a few weeks for it to hit all users.\\nThat's not all, though, now OpenAI is speaking to the Real-Time aI which is all about voice experiences building. Currently, it has web socket support but webRTC support is here and is built for the internet.\\nNow rather than elf on the shelf, OpenAI brought out a Fawn on the Lawn with a micro controller inside it. When the Fawn was plugged into the MacBook Pro, it started saying \\\"Merry Christmas, what are you talking about it?\\\" and responded saying that webRTC was a little complicated, and the Fawn switched the conversation to giving gifts on Christmas. The briefing here is that you can create custom assistants using voice – pretty neat.\\nNext up is fine-tuning, and the API model currently supports preference and supervised types. So, for day nine, OpenAI ushered in the o1 model in the API, as well as real-time enhancements and fine-tuning.\\nThere were a few more minor things shipped today as well – those including new SDKs – Go and Java –, a refreshed flow for creating an API key, released OpenAI dev talks on YouTube, and will be doing an AMA, starting now, for the next hour on the OpenAI developer forum.\\nAnd day nine is wrapped. It was still quick, though a bit longer than day eight, but we'll have to see what day ten brings tomorrow. OpenAI didn't tease what's to come, which means anything is on the table.\\nWelcome to day 10!\\n\\nWelcome to day 10 of '12 Days of OpenAI'! After yesterday's developer-heavy announcements we're expecting something a bit more consumer friendly today. What will it be? Tune in at 10am PT to find out.\\nGet using ChatGPT Projects\\n\\nBack in day six, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Projects, as part of its 12 Days of OpenAI, and if you're the sort of person who loves to say organized, you're going to love using it. Luckily for you TechRadar writer Eric Hal Schwartz has whipped up a handy guide to using ChatGPT Projects. Enjoy!\\nCall ChatGPT today\\n\\nOpenAI's is bringing ChatGPT to your telephone. They've told us to add ChatGPT to your contacts so you can, yes, call ChatGPT. This is quite a change for the AI company. It's very old school. You can call ChatGPT toll-free to chat with it by voice.\\nThe number, by the way, if you want to play along is: 1-800-chatgpt\\nAny phone will work\\n\\nWhile the demo started with an iPhone, the small group of OpenAI engineers soon showed how you can call ChatGPT with any phone, including a classic flip phone and then an old-school rotary phone (ask your grandparents).\\nThe actual toll-free number, by the way, is 1-800-242-8478.\\nAnyone can get 15 minutes of free ChatGPT calls. For more time, you'll need to create and ChatGPT account.\\nChatGPT text calls will work with WhatsApp\\n\\nBasically, ChatGPT calling will work with your WhatsApp account. Scanning the QR code included with the stream gets you directly to the WhatsApp experience inside ChatGPT.\\nThese conversations are text-based only. You do not need to have a ChatGPT account to make it work\\nIt's worth noting that the voice Call ChatGPT feature is for the US only.\\nThe text-based WhatsApp is how international users will use Call ChatGPT.\\nWelcome to day 11 of '12 Days of OpenAI'\\n\\nWelcome to the penultimate day of '12 Days of OpenAI'! It's starting to feel like OpenAI's product announcements have been going on for most of December at this point, but we're getting very close the end now, the big announcement on day 12. What will it be? Well, we still have one more day to go before we get there, and we're still wondering what we'll get today, so don't forget to come back at 10am PT for another exciting announcement from OpenAI.\\nDay 11: Time for an update to image generation?\\n\\nYesterday we had a really intriguing announcement from OpenAI. You can now text through WhatsApp to talk to the ChatGPT chatbot, which is a pretty convenient way of using it. This was quite a surprise, since WhatsApp is owned by Meta, who has its own MetaAI.Since yesterday's announcement was about ChatGPT we're guessing that today's will be about something else entirely... However, there's still been no upgrades to the DALL-E 3 image generator that is part of ChatGPT, so our money is on something image related today.\\n\\nIt's day 11, and Kevin, OpenAI's chief product lead, is kicking things off by discussing desktop apps with two colleagues dressed to the nines in Christmas-themed blazers. But the bigger idea is a shift to 'Agentic' in that ChatGPT can do a lot more for you and on your behalf.\\nFor instance, with the ChatGPT desktop app on the Mac, you can easily access it as a floating window layered on your desktop. Desktop apps will likely be the focus of day 11, with hints of 'Agentic.'\\nIn this demo of the ChatGPT app for the Mac, you can let the AI view and get context for one of your apps. When you select it through 'Working with Apps,' it will be able to view it and assist. What is new today is that Warp is working within this flow.\\n\\n\\nBeyond viewing and understanding the app, it's still ChatGPT and can use the various functions or features the AI and its model can perform. One example within Warp is that ChatGPT can see what you see on screen and also view what else is within the app so that a long list of codes can be scrolled without needing to scroll. Neat.\\nCompared to the Windows Recall feature, ChatGPT is about working with apps rather than recording and building a library to look back into. In another demo, the OpenAI team uses ChatGPT with XCode, which allows it to work within Apple's development application. You can ask for it here to help generate code or solve a problem.\\nIn this demo, OpenAI asked ChatGPT for help with code within XCode and then pasted the resulting code it delivered into XCode. Another new feature that was approved on the spot is the ability for ChatGPT to put the created code directly into XCode – which could end upstream linking some workflows.\\nWhile greenlighting that new feature, ChatGPT's code failed twice during this live demo. On the third try, the OpenAI team did get the code to run successfully.\\n\\nRegarding using ChatGPT for writing, OpenAI has announced support today for Apple Notes, Quip, and Notion. We can expect that functionality to roll out today, and in a live demo during day 11, the team is going through a document in which they're creating a guide for a walking tour within Notion.\\nWith the new functionality, ChatGPT is working directly with Notion. This live demo is focused on the selected text within the documentation, and the task is to \\\"fill out these talking points.\\\" You can also choose ChatGPT's Search functionality to have the response generated – in this case, talking points on Emperor Norton – to provide citations with its sources for the generated text. It's basically showing it's work.\\n\\nBeyond just selecting text, copying in, and then copying out with a final past, ChatGPT is debuting support for Advanced Voice Mode. In this case, for a \\\"Holiday Party Set List\\\" within Apple Notes and asking Santa via ChatGPT for feedback on the proposed songs. It can even tell you if you did something wrong, in this case, writing \\\"Freezy the Snowman\\\" instead of \\\"Frosty the Snowman.\\\"\\n\\nYou won't need to wait long for the ChatGPT Mac Desktop app to get all of these new features, including more support for \\\"Working with Apps\\\" and the arrival of \\\"Advanced Voice Mode,\\\" as it's being pushed to the app now. Just be sure your Mac ChatGPT app is up to date.\\nIt'll be coming to the Windows app soon, but no exact time frame was given.\\nThat concludes Day 11 of 12 Days of OpenAI in terms of news, but Kevin did tease some big news tomorrow. And rather than closing out day eleven with a joke, we got a saxophone solo.\\n\\nWelcome to Day 12 of '12 Days of OpenAI'!\\n\\nWelcome to the very last day of '12 Days of OpenAI'! It's hard to believe that it's almost over, but at the start of December we had no idea that OpenAI would be finishing the year with such a massive array of new product announcements, and yet here we are.Yesterday OpenAI graced the Mac ChatGPT app with support for a bunch of new apps, and also made it possible to use Advanced Voice Mode with them.What will we get today? Well, we're still holding out for an AI agent that can work autonomously on your behalf like a true digital assistant. Will we get one? Make sure you're here at 10am PT to find out. Whatever happens, we have a feeling that OpenAI has left the best until last...\\n\\nIt's the big day – well, the final day of 12 Days of OpenAI – and Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, is here as they're announcing two new models: o3 and o3 mini. The first is a 'very strong model,' as described by Mark, an OpenAI team member.\\nFrom shared data in the live stream, it seems that o3 is exceptionally skilled at programming and mathematics; it was called \\\"incredible\\\" at the latter. It can also match up with PhD style tasks and questions. OpenAI is clearly touting the functionality of o3 here.\\n\\nNow, the Arc Prize Foundation President is joining the table and debuting a new state-of-the-art score for Arc AGI. Essentially, it showcases puzzles that previous AI technology has had trouble completing.\\nEven so, o3 has achieved a new state-of-the-art score on Ark AGI, currently leading the leaderboard on low computing and also delivering impressive results on higher levels. It's a new territory within the Arc Agi world, considering the power of O3. The Arc Prize Foundation will also be partnering with OpenAI next year to work on future benchmarks.\\n\\n\\nNow, it's o3 mini time, which comes just a few months after o1 mini. As noted earlier, o3 Mini is not launching today, but OpenAI is opening up access to select safety and security researchers.\\nOpenAI promises this is a new frontier in the cost-efficiency sector with o3 mini, and the model focuses on low, medium, and high-reasoning efforts. You can see some early results shared below, but OpenAI is now switching to a live demo of o3 mini.\\n\\nIn the demo, OpenAI is showcasing how o3 mini can perform with coding and programming tasks. OpenAI is using o3 mini medium to run through some input code and see the export.\\n\\nOpenAI asked o3 Mini to write a script to evaluate itself, and it seemingly spits back out the results on its own model – essentially, its math model performance and seeing where it can push performance. o3 mini will also be able to handle API tasks and match up with o1, but it stands as a more cost-effective solution.\\n\\nBeyond internal safety and security testing, OpenAI is opening up o3 for external safety researchers for the first time. You'll soon be able to apply for the external safety testing application on OpenAI's website, as the shared image shows it opens today, December 20, 2024. This will speed up the process and get these new models out sooner.\\n\\nSam Altman noted that o3 will plan to launch around the 'end of January' 2024 with o3 mini launching shortly after that. And that officially wrapped the 12 Days of OpenAI with OpenAI's CEO wishing us all a Merry Christmas and then hearing his colleagues cheering off camera.\\nIt's simply been a packed 12 days of announcements from OpenAI with Sora – the text-to-video generator – likely stealing the show as the most anticipated. Still new functionality for ChatGPT like Projects and Canvas, as well as new developer tools, all stack for pretty big set of improvements for OpenAI's core products.\\nDeepSeek hit by outages – plus all the latest news about the ChatGPT rival\\nWhat is DeepSeek?

announced in the past 12 days\\nBy Andrew Tarantola Published December 20, 2024 3:39 PM\\n\\nRolf van Root / Unsplash\\nTable of Contents\\nOpenAI kicked off its inaugural “12 Days of OpenAI” media blitz on December 5, each day unveiling new features, models, subscription tiers, and capabilities for its growing ChatGPT product ecosystem during a series of live-stream events.\\nHere’s a quick rundown of everything the company announced.\\nDay 1: OpenAI unleashes its o1 reasoning model and introduces ChatGPT Pro\\nOpenAI o1 and o1 pro mode in ChatGPT — 12 Days of OpenAI: Day 1\\nOpenAI kicked off the festivities with a couple major announcements. First, the company revealed the full-function version of its new o1 family of reasoning models and announced that they would be immediately available, albeit in limited amounts, to its $20/month Plus tier subscribers. In order to get full use of the new model (as well as every other model that OpenAI offers, plus unlimited access to Advanced Voice Mode), users will need to spring for OpenAI’s newest, and highest, subscription package: the $200/month Pro tier.\\nDay 2: OpenAI expands its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research program\\nOn the event’s second day, the OpenAI development team announced that it is expanding its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research program, which allows developers to train the company’s models as subject matter experts that “excel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,” according to the program’s website. Though it is geared more toward institutes, universities, and enterprises than individual users, the company plans to make the program’s API available to the public early next year.\\nRelated\\n\\nChatGPT just got a bump to its coding powers\\nOpenAI opens up developer access to the full o1 reasoning model\\nYou can now try out ChatGPT Search for free\\n\\nDay 3: OpenAI’s Sora video generator has finally arrived. Huzzah?\\nOn the third day of OpenAI, Sam Altman gave to me: Sora video generation. Yeah, OK, so the cadence for that doesn’t quite work but hey, neither does Sora. OpenAI’s long-awaited and highly touted video generation model, which has been heavily hyped since February, made its official debut on December 9 to middling reviews. Turns out that two years into the AI boom, being the leading company in the space and only rolling out 20-second clips at 1080p doesn’t really move the needle, especially when many of its competitors already offer similar performance without requiring a $20- or $200-per-month subscription.\\nDay 4: OpenAI expands its Canvas\\nOpenAI followed up its Sora revelations with a set of improvements to its recently released Canvas feature, the company’s answer to Anthropic’s Artifacts. During its Day 4 live stream, the OpenAI development team revealed that Canvas will now be integrated directly into the GPT-4o model, making it natively available to users at all price tiers, including free. You can now run Python code directly within the Canvas space, enabling the chatbot to analyze it directly and offer suggestions for improvement, as well as use the feature to construct custom GPTs.\\nDay 5: ChatGPT teams up with Apple Intelligence\\nOn day five, OpenAI announced that it is working with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence, specifically Siri, allowing users to invoke the chatbot directly through iOS. Apple had announced that this would be a thing back when it first unveiled Apple Intelligence but, with the release of iOS 18.2, that functionality is now a reality. If only Apple’s users actually wanted to use Apple’s AI.\\nDay 6: Advanced Voice Mode now has the power of sight and can speak Santa\\n2024 was the year that Advanced Voice Mode got its eyes. OpenAI announced on Day 6 of its live-stream event that its conversational chatbot model can now view the world around it through a mobile device’s video camera or via screen sharing. This will enable users to ask the AI questions about their surroundings without having to describe the scene or upload a photo of what they’re looking at. The company also released a seasonal voice for AVM which mimics Jolly Old St. Nick, just in case you don’t have time to drive your kids to the mall and meet the real one in person.\\nDay 7: OpenAI introduces Projects for ChatGPT\\nOpenAI closed out the first week of announcements with one that is sure to bring a smile to the face of every boy and girl: folders! Specifically, the company revealed its new smart folder system, dubbed “Projects,” which allows users to better organize their chat histories and uploaded documents by subject.\\nDay 8: ChatGPT Search is now available to everybody\\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT Search function, which debuted in October, is now available to all logged-in users, regardless of their subscription tier. The feature works by searching the internet for information about the user’s query, scraping the info it finds from relevant websites, and then synthesize that data into a conversational answer. It essentially eliminates the need to click through a search results page and is functionally identical to what Perplexity AI offers, allowing ChatGPT to compete with the increasingly popular app. Be warned, however: a recent study has shown the feature to be “confidently wrong” in many of its answers.\\nDay 9: the full o1 model comes to OpenAI’s API\\nLike being gifted a sweater from not one but two aunts, OpenAI revealed on day nine that it is allowing select developers to access the full version of its o1 reasoning model through the API. The company is also rolling out real-time API updates, a new model customization technique called Preference Fine-Tuning, and new SDKs for Go and Java.\\nDay 10: 1-800-ChatGPT\\nIn an effort to capture that final market segment that it couldn’t already reach — specifically, people without internet access — OpenAI has released the 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478) chatline. Dial in from any land or mobile number within the U.S. to speak with the AI’s Advanced Voice Mode for up to 15 minutes for free.\\nDay 11: ChatGPT now works with even more coding apps\\nLast month, OpenAI granted the Mac-based desktop version of ChatGPT the ability to interface directly with a number of popular coding applications, allowing its AI to pull snippets directly from them rather than require users to copy and paste the code into its chatbot’s prompt window. On Thursday, the company announced that it is drastically expanding the number of apps and IDEs that ChatGPT can collaborate with. And it’s not just coding apps; ChatGPT now also works with conventional text programs like Apple Notes, Notion, and Quip. You can even launch Advanced Voice Mode in a separate window as you work, asking questions and getting suggestions from the AI about your current project.\\nDay 12: OpenAI teases its upcoming o3 and o3-mini reasoning models\\nFor the 12th day of OpenAI’s live-stream event, CEO Sam Altman made a final appearance to discuss what the company has in store for the new year — specifically, its next-generation reasoning models, o3 and o3-mini. The naming scheme is a bit odd (and done to avoid copyright issues with U.K. telecom, O2) but the upcoming models reportedly offer superior performance on some of the industry’s most challenging math, science, and coding benchmark tests — even compared to o1, the full version of which was formally released less than a fortnight ago. The company is currently offering o3-mini as a preview to researchers for safety testing and red teaming trials, though there’s no word yet on when everyday users will be able to try the models for themselves.\\nEditors’ Recommendations\\n\\nOpenAI teases its ‘breakthrough’ next-generation o3 reasoning model\\nYes, it’s real: ChatGPT has its own 800 number\\nI tried out Google’s latest AI tool that generates images in a fun, new way\\nGoogle strikes back with an answer to OpenAI’s Sora launch\\n​​OpenAI spills tea on Musk as Meta seeks block on for-profit dreams\\n\\nTopics\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nChatGPT\\nFeatures\\n\\n\\nAndrew Tarantola\\nComputing Writer\\ntwitter Email\\nAndrew Tarantola is a journalist with more than a decade reporting on emerging technologies ranging from robotics and machine…\\n\\nComputing\\n\\nChatGPT has folders now\\n\\nOpenAI is once again re-creating a Claude feature in ChatGPT. The company announced during Friday's \\\"12 Days of OpenAI\\\" event that its chatbot will now offer a folder system called \\\"Projects\\\" to help users organize their chats and data.\\n“This is really just another organizational tool. I think of these as smart folders,” Thomas Dimson, an OpenAI staff member, said during the live stream.\\nRead more\\n\\nComputing\\n\\nOpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode can now see your screen and analyze videos\\n\\nOpenAI's \\\"12 Days of OpenAI\\\" continued apace on Wednesday with the development team announcing a new seasonal voice for ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode (AVM), as well as new video and screen-sharing capabilities for the conversational AI feature.\\nSanta Mode, as OpenAI is calling it, is a seasonal feature for AVM, and offers St. Nick's dulcet tones as a preset voice option. It is being released to Plus and Pro subscribers through the website and mobile and desktop apps starting today and will remain so until early January. To access the limited-time feature, first sign in to your Plus or Pro account, then click on the snowflake icon next to the text prompt window.\\nRead more\\n\\nComputing\\n\\nOpenAI’s Sora doesn’t feel like the game-changer it was supposed to be\\n\\nOpenAI has teased, and repeatedly delayed, the release of Sora for nearly a year. On Tuesday, the company finally unveiled a fully functional version of the new video-generation model destined for public use and, despite the initial buzz, more and more early users of the release don't seem overly impressed. And neither am I.\\nhttps://x.com/OpenAI/status/1758192957386342435\\nRead more\\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.\\n\\nFacebook\\nInstagram\\nTwitter\\nYouTube\\nPinterest\\nLinkedIn\\nTikTok\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\n\\nMobile\\n\\nComputing\\nGaming\\nAudio / Video\\nSmart Home\\nEntertainment\\nAutomotive\\nSpace\\nStreaming Guides\\nOriginal Shows\\n\\nHow-To\\n\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\nContact Us\\nEditorial Guidelines\\n\\nLogo & Accolade Licensing\\n\\n\\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\\n\\nBranded Content\\nDigital Trends Wallpapers\\nDigital Trends in Spanish\\n\\n\\n\\nPortland\\nNew York\\nChicago\\nDetroit\\nLos Angeles\\n\\nToronto\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise With Us\\nWork With Us\\nDiversity & Inclusion\\nTerms of Use\\nPrivacy Policy\\nDo Not Sell or Share My Information\\nManage cookie preferences\\nPress Room\\nSitemap\\n\\nDigital Trends Media Group may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\\n©2024 Digital Trends Media Group, a Designtechnica Company.
