Sora lead Bill Peebles replied to a post from a colleague named \\\"roon\\\" about OpenAI being \\\"unbelievably back\\\" with a one-word confirmation: \\\"Correct.\\\"\\nA full release of the \\\"o1\\\" reasoning model has been highly anticipated among the AI community, and it's seen by many industry pundits as a critical move to potentially place OpenAI ahead of competitors like Google and Anthropic.\\nOn the other hand, the potential upcoming launch of Sora comes with some controversy. Artists who tested the model through an invite-only research preview recently leaked it in protest, claiming OpenAI used them for \\\"unpaid R&D and PR.\\\" Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told The Wall Street Journal in March that Sora would become available by the end of 2024.\\nGoogle has positioned itself to compete with Sora by releasing its own video-generation model called Veo in a private preview. The company now offers Veo to businesses through its Vertex AI platform.

The company, with a reported 500 million monthly active users, is taking bold steps to increase monetization of the company’s intelligence products while also adding capabilities. Their latest innovations include Sora, a text-to-video offering, and ChatGPT Pro, an offering which includes its o1 and other powerful reasoning models.\\nHeadlining this week’s releases from OpenAI is Sora, a text-to-video model that enhances OpenAI’s suite of multimodal offerings. Sora began testing back in February and has only been accessible to selected approved users since launch. Starting this week, Sora became available to certain OpenAI subscribers. It allows users to generate up to 20-second-long videos and gives them the ability to animate still images and remix videos. OpenAI also noted the company has plans to further refine the offering, including enhanced safety and deepfake mitigation, before releasing an even more powerful text to video offering. Sora’s release marks another step forward for OpenAI’s capabilities.\\nInvestors in OpenAI also cheered the release, with access to Sora only available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers. These subscription tiers currently cost $20 per month for Plus and $200 per month for Pro. The company is leaving access to most of its basic models at no cost, but investors have been eagerly awaiting the release of these more powerful models to build a paying member base. I recently wrote about OpenAI’s latest capital raise and highlighted the company’s ambitious revenue forecasts in documents seen by potential investors. It appears the company is taking their first steps to hit some of the revenue goals they believe are possible with their intelligence offerings.\\nOpenAI’s recent product launches and subscription adjustments reflect its commitment to providing cutting-edge AI tools tailored to a wide range of users. By introducing Sora and the ChatGPT Pro tier, OpenAI continues to advance the accessibility and application of artificial intelligence across various sectors.\\n\\nStay on Top of Market Trends\\nThe Carson Investment Research newsletter offers up-to-date market news, analysis and insights.

Please stay tuned!\\nThis is currently not available on ChatGPT Free, Team, Enterprise, and Edu.\\nOur video generation model is rolling out at sora.com⁠.\\n​\\nEarlier this year, we introduced Sora⁠, our model that can create realistic videos from text, and shared our initial research progress⁠ on world simulation. Sora serves as a foundation for AI that understands and simulates reality—an important step towards developing models that can interact with the physical world.\\n​\\nResources\\nSora - Help Center Collection\\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning (December 6)\\nIn this alpha phase, we are working with select participants to gather feedback on how this feature can be used effectively and responsibly. At this time, we do not have a timeline or additional details to share on broader public availability.\\nWe’re expanding our Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research Program to enable developers and machine learning engineers to create expert models fine-tuned to excel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks.\\nThis new model customization technique enables developers to customize our models using dozens to thousands of high quality tasks and grade the model’s response with provided reference answers. This technique reinforces how the model reasons through similar problems and improves its accuracy on specific tasks in that domain.\\nResources\\nHow to access Reinforcement Fine-Tuning?\\nChatGPT Pro, o1, and o1 Pro Mode (December 5)\\nChatGPT Pro plans are fully available for purchase. o1 Pro Mode is only available on ChatGPT Pro.\\nToday, we’re adding ChatGPT Pro, a $200 monthly plan that enables scaled access to the best of OpenAI’s models and tools. This plan includes unlimited access to our smartest model, OpenAI o1, as well as to o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Voice. It also includes o1 pro mode, a version of o1 that uses more compute to think harder and provide even better answers to the hardest problems. In the future, we expect to add more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features to this plan.\\nResources\\nWhat is ChatGPT Pro?\\nUsing OpenAI o1 models and GPT-4o models on ChatGPT\\n\\nRelated Articles\\nWhat is the ChatGPT model selector?Model Release NotesOpenAI o1 and o1-mini Usage Limits on ChatGPT and the APIUsing OpenAI o1 models and GPT-4o models on ChatGPTOpenAI o1 models - FAQ [ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu]\\nDid this answer your question?\\n😞😐😃\\n\\n\\nChatGPT\\nAPI\\nDALL·E\\n\\nService Status\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}], \"response_time\": 2.89}\n",
